# Digital-Logic
This repository is for PCBs related to digital logic.
To build these PCBs, we used Autodesk's EAGLE, a CAD software for making schematics and board files. All of the files you see ending in .brd are "Board" files, which show what the board connections, shapes, and layers actually look like.
